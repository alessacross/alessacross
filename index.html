    <p>I'm Alessa Cross, a current third-year at the <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">University of Chicago</a> pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. <br>I am Japanese and Australian. I was 
    born and raised in the heart of Tokyo until I turned 14 years old, when <br>I decided to attend a boarding school, Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. 

    <p>I first started programming in October 2017. While I've just started my journey in the world of computing, <br>I have worked on several projects and taught myself a few languages so feel free to take a look at what I've done so far. <br>I've built this website so there is physically more space and freedom (than in a page-long resum√©) to share what I've <br>worked on and express with more nuance my passion for materializing incredible ideas using code. I am excited to continue adding <br>to this page and to build cooler projects with more beautifully organized code with each passing day.</p>
