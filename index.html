    <p>Welcome to my page!</p>
    <p>I'm Alessa Cross, and I'm currently a third-year undergraduate at the <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">University of Chicago</a> pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science. <br>I am Japanese and Australian. I was 
    born and raised in the heart of Tokyo until I turned 14 years old, when I decided to attend <br>a boarding school, Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. 

    I first started programming in October 2017. <br>While I've just started my journey in the world of computing, I have worked on several projects so feel free to take a look <br>at what I've done so far. I've built this website so there is physically more space and freedom (than in a page-long resum√©) <br>to share the projects I've worked on and express with more nuance my love for materializing incredible ideas <br>through programming. I am excited to continue adding to this page-- writing better code with each passing day.
