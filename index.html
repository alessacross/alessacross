    <p>Welcome to my page!</p>
    <p>I'm Alessa Cross, and I'm currently a third-year undergraduate at the <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">University of Chicago</a> pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science. <br>I am Japanese and Australian. I was 
    born and raised in the heart of Tokyo until I turned 14 years old, when I decided to attend <br>a boarding school, Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. 

    <p>I first started programming in October 2017. While I've just started my journey in the world of computing, <br>I have worked on several projects so feel free to take a look at what I've done so far. <br>I've built this website so there is physically more space and freedom (than in a page-long resum√©) to share the projects <br>I've worked on and express with more nuance my love for materializing incredible ideas through programming. <br>I am excited to continue adding to this page-- writing better code with each passing day.</p>
